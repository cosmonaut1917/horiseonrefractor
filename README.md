# horiseonrefractor
My motivation to refactor this website was to make it easier to read and to make sure it is able to be found by search engines easier and faster.

I did this project to help myself learn how to use semantic HTML along with other methods of programming.

What i did was change some div classes to sections that were all related to eachother and grouped them up in that section

I learned how to use semantic HTML to improve a website
